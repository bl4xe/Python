# Here you'll find some projects I did to exercise Python a bit. I'm a total beginner so don't expect too much.
# grades.py is a basic grades calculator (You can calculate the average of different subjects aswell as the overall average)
# Heads or Tails.py is just what it sounds like: A simple Program which randomly outputs either "Heads" or "Tails".
